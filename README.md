# PyTorch

Welcome to the PyTorch repository! This README file will guide you through the installation and usage of PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. Follow the instructions below to get started with PyTorch and unleash the potential of neural networks.

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides a flexible and intuitive interface for building and training deep neural networks. With PyTorch, you can easily create complex models, perform efficient computations on GPUs, and seamlessly integrate with other Python libraries.

## Installation

To install PyTorch, follow the steps that correspond to your system:

### Windows and Linux

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

1. Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

1. Activate the virtual environment:

   - Windows:
     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Linux:
     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

1. Install PyTorch using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   ```

### macOS

1. Open a terminal.

1. Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

1. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

1. Install PyTorch using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   ```
